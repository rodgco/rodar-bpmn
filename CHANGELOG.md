# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Upgraded MIWG conformance test suite to the 2025 release (21 reference files, up from 5)
- Parse conformance now covers 17/21 MIWG reference files (A.1.0–C.9.2); 4 files skipped due to unqualified XML namespace conventions
- B.2.0 parse tests now validate across all processes (official reference has 4 processes)
- Download script (`scripts/download_miwg.sh`) rewritten to fetch from latest GitHub release

### Added

- Parse tests for 12 new MIWG reference files: A.2.1, A.4.0, C.2.0, C.4.0, C.5.0, C.6.0, C.7.0, C.8.0, C.8.1, C.9.0, C.9.1, C.9.2
- `TestHelper.all_process_elements/1` for merging elements across all processes in a diagram

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- `mix rodar.scaffold` mix task — generates handler module stubs from a BPMN file with correct behaviours and callbacks
- `Rodar.Scaffold` module — core scaffolding logic for task extraction and handler code generation
- `Rodar.Scaffold.Discovery` module — convention-based handler auto-discovery at `<AppName>.Workflow.<BpmnFilename>.Handlers.<TaskName>` paths (namespace configurable via `config :rodar, :scaffold_namespace`)
- `Scaffold.bpmn_base_name/1` and `Scaffold.default_module_prefix/2` — shared naming helpers for scaffold and discovery
- `Diagram.load/2` now accepts `:bpmn_file`, `:app_name`, and `:discover_handlers` options for automatic handler discovery at parse time
- `mix rodar.run` automatically discovers scaffolded handlers and prints discovered vs passthrough status

### Changed

- **Project renamed from `rodar_bpmn` to `rodar`** — package is now `:rodar`, modules use `Rodar.*`, config uses `config :rodar`, mix tasks are `mix rodar.*`, telemetry events use `[:rodar, ...]`. BPMN notation atoms (`:bpmn_*`) unchanged.
- `mix rodar.run` hook output now prints each node's own result instead of propagated downstream results — nodes that forwarded the token show `[OK]` even when a later node fails
- Handler convention path changed from `Bpmn.Handlers.<File>` to `Workflow.<File>.Handlers` (folder: `workflow/<file>/handlers/`), with namespace configurable via `config :rodar, :scaffold_namespace`

### Fixed

- Script task language resolution now checks `:scriptFormat` attribute (standard BPMN 2.0) in addition to `:type`, defaulting to `"elixir"` when neither is present — script tasks no longer return `{:not_implemented}` when only `scriptFormat` is set

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- BPMN lane support — parser extracts `laneSet`/`lane`/`childLaneSet`/`flowNodeRef` into process attrs (`:lane_set` key)
- `Rodar.Lane` module — stateless query API: `find_lane_for_node/2`, `node_lane_map/1`, `all_lanes/1`
- Lane XML export with full round-trip fidelity (including nested child lane sets)
- `Rodar.Validation.validate_lanes/2` — lane referential integrity checks (`:lane_flow_node_ref`, `:lane_duplicate_ref`)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- `usage-rules.md` — package-level usage rules file with GOOD/BAD code examples for AI agents, included in hex package

### Fixed

- Execution history now correctly classifies preceding nodes as `:ok` when a downstream node suspends (e.g., user task returning `{:manual, _}`). Previously all nodes in the chain were recorded with the propagated downstream result instead of their own

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Replace `VERSION` file with inline version in `mix.exs` as the single source of truth
- Extract release tooling to `rodar_release` package — release command is now `mix rodar_release`
- Bump type now controls the release version (decided at release time) instead of the next dev version
- Remove `-dev` suffix convention from versioning workflow

### Removed

- `VERSION` file — no longer needed
- `Mix.Tasks.Rodar.Release` — replaced by `mix rodar_release` from the `rodar_release` package

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- `Rodar.Expression.ScriptEngine` behaviour and `Rodar.Expression.ScriptRegistry` for pluggable script language support in script tasks
- `Diagram.load/2` accepts a `:handler_map` option to inject handler modules into service task elements at parse time
- `Activity.Task.Service` falls back to `TaskRegistry` lookup by task ID when no inline `:handler` attribute is present

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Update repository URLs from rodar-bpmn to rodar

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Update repository URLs to rodar-project organization
- Moved Roadmap to parent folder

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- GitHub Actions workflow to deploy ExDoc documentation to GitHub Pages on push to main

### Changed

- Update installation instructions to use GitHub repository instead of Hex.pm
- Update homepage URL in mix.exs to point to GitHub Pages documentation

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Clarify versioning and release workflow documentation in CLAUDE.md, README.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md with concrete examples and step-by-step guide
